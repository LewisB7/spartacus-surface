FEATURES

Compute leaf sunlit fraction (wavelength independent)
Broadband or spectral fluxes each optional
Gas optics
Closed forest: optimization by looking for veg cover = 0 or 1

BUG FIXES

Longwave forest
Longwave urban


CHECK

Unvegetated urban
Eigen decomposition correctly treats multiple spectral intervals
Vegetation extinction should be wavelength independent and stored in canopy_props
