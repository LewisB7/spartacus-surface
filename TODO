FEATURES

Compute leaf sunlit fraction (wavelength independent)
Broadband or spectral fluxes each optional
Gas optics
Closed forest: optimization by looking for veg cover = 0 or 1
Report radiation components into a horizontal and vertical surface for calculation MRT
Road/roofs/wall direct fraction, and direct flux attenuated only by air
Dump out inputs like in ecRad
Combine lw_spectral_props%calc_monochromatic_emission and calc_simple_spectrum_lw into one function call for broadband Planck function

BUG FIXES

Fix non-zero residual in urban longwave when nstream>=2

CHECK

Eigen decomposition correctly treats multiple spectral intervals
Separate temperatures for clear-air, veg-air and veg
Check that removing tan0 on line 332 does not break the RAMI4PILPS agreement
Longwave forest
Longwave urban
Computational cost w.r.t. ecRad and dependence on number of streams
