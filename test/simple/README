Calling "make" in this directory will run SPARTACUS-Surface on the
following test input files:

  test_surfaces_in.nc - tests the four surface types (flat, forest,
    unvegetated urban and vegetated urban) with a simple two-layer
    canopy

  test_consistency_in.nc - tests the consistency of the forest and
    urban solvers by running them on an identical forest profile; the
    fluxes components ought to be the same for these two profiles

The results are written in *_out.nc.
